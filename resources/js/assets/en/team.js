            "From an early age I had a great passion for 3D and how it was developed. Over the years I learned and created several projects in my academic career, from games, short films and more recently 3D visualization. I always try to make our 3D images as realistic as possible, always conveying the intended concept to customers."

            "Hello! My name is Carolina Andrade and I have a degree in Design from the University of Madeira. I've always liked the area of Design and although it was an area divided into several sectors, from product design, to graphic design, among others, for me, the \"power\" of space design has always captivated me in transforming and giving value to all spaces.",
            "Renovating or creating a new space is sometimes challenging. However, it is these situations that make us realize the value of design in our lives, in which it challenges the designer to develop and create new products/spaces, always thinking about human behavior, through his knowledge. Each corner tells a story, a theme, and a purpose and through design, it is possible to turn ideas into reality."
